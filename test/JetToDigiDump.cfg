# Description:  Prints out Jets, consituent CaloTowers, constituent RecHits and associated Digis (the digis for HCAL only).
#               The user can specify which level in the config file:
#               DumpLevel="Jets":    Printout of jets and their kinematic quantities.
#               DumpLevel="Towers":  Nested Printout of jets and their constituent CaloTowers
#               DumpLevel="RecHits": Nested Printout of jets, constituent CaloTowers and constituent RecHits
#               DumpLevel="Digis":   Nested Printout of jets, constituent CaloTowers, RecHits and all the HCAL digis 
#                                    associated with the RecHit channel (no links exist to go back to actual digis used).
#               Does simple sanity checks on energy sums at each level: jets=sum of towers, tower=sum of RecHits.
#               Does quick and dirty estimate of the fC/GeV factor that was applied to make the RecHit from the Digis.
